over view of kotlin over a java in android
First of all both are name from island. in 2017 goole declred kotlin was android's offical language
kotlin is boilerpalte removed form of java. Boiler plate code means huge code for simple job. kotlin avoid this boilerpalte code 
similarities: 
Both are statically typed language it means type checking of variables at compile-time
As per above said both of them named from island. 
pervious day i conclude Kotlin does not have JVM but that was wrong after the converting bytecode it was run or execute by JVM instead of processor to get a quick response. here JIT is used for converting byte code to native code as like java.
It was open source as liks as java for Android to bulid a application. Also it interopted java libraies
Diffrences:
kotlin has null safe and smart casts java doesn't. here single tone class (class have only one instance at a time) created easly compared to java. Lambda functions in kotlin are very effictive.

The main advantages of kotlin is, it have dataclass, extenstion, smartCast  but drawback kotlin is 15-20% late complilation compared to java. 
after todays topic i learned What is bulid: Stand alone form that can be run on computer from it selft, and seen Y2K Bug.
