compeleted hello world task
first i choose a min sdk as android 6.0 
in activity layout the textview was defaulty constrained then i incersed it size to 30sp. for the size i referd what is sp measurement. sp is Scale indepened Pixel it means size with bonding with the screen. for text we use sp for desing we use dp(density independet pixel). then i execute the progrm by ADV. After the execution i deside to change the background of the layout here i faced a simple problem in coding side i used the keyword 'Android:Background ="#B5EA5D"' it throughs error as 'expression expected but package name found' laterly i found a properties to layout at UI side so i choosed that to solve it.. for the hello world task i used only layout side not from code side i still block on that code. 

the second shecdule of the day is Android architecture.
Start to read from basic layer but some word are navigate to refer it. so it became a some big and intresting topic to read. I learned what is architecture and how its worked after this went to its type first i had conflict with deign patters and archtecture then i recoginized both are same.then read aboubt MVC,MVP,MVVM and diffrent between them.


At last completed two topics then i searched tomorrow topic and had overview of them and pick a resource for that.
that fore this day end like this way
